00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:05,753
Welcome to English in the minutes

2
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:08,092
Merry means happy!

3
00:00:08,577 --> 00:00:11,335
So, what might it mean if someone says,

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,907
the more the merrier?

5
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:17,312
Dan, do you mind if I bring some friends to your party?

6
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:18,180
Not at all

7
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:19,354
The more the merrier!

8
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:20,738
Awesome!

9
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:23,864
They're in my amateur accordion group.

10
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,857
We want to play music at your party!

11
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:30,011
Oh, they cannot come.

12
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:33,520
You just said, the more the merrier

13
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:37,716
I didn't said the "The more amateur accordion players the merrier."

14
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:43,325
The more the merrier means that

15
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:45,721
the more people who are at an event,

16
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:47,810
the more fun the event will be

17
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,937
We can use this expression to talk about things too, not just people.

18
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:56,634
For example, the more music the merrier!

19
00:00:57,437 --> 00:00:58,190
Usually.
