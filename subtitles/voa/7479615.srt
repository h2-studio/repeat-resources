Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,760
A "sketch" is a simple drawing

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,730
meant to show the main parts of something.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,840
But, what does it mean if something is sketchy?

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,020
So, are you doing anything fun over the long weekend?

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,120
Yes! I'm going on a midnight hike at Fort Danger Park

7
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:25,655
Is that a good idea?

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,286
Weird things happen at Fort Danger Park even in the daytime

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,300
It's not as sketchy as people think

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,030
I hike there at night all the time!

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Of course you do.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,030
Sketchy has a couple of meanings.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,170
It can describe something that is not complete or clear

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,460
But it can also describe something dangerous or bad.

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,020
This usage of the word is very casual and informal

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,720
And that's English in a Minute!
