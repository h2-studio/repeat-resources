00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,820
Welcome to English at a Minute!

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,613
a nickel is worth five cents

3
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:10,620
and a dime is worth ten.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,940
But what does the phrase nickel and dimed mean?

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,970
Dan do you want to get pizza?

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,970
I'm craving pete's pizza palace

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,600
Pete's is good but they always nickel and dime you.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,650
The last time I ate there I had to pay for extra napkins

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,540
What?

10
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:33,155
But I love Pete's.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,970
I know, I'll bring napkins

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,440
If you are being nickel and dimed,

13
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:46,470
a business is unfairly charging you extra money for small things or services

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,800
Dan feels nickel and dimed at Pete's

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,890
and it sounds like he is right to feel that way

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,710
and that's English in a Minute!
