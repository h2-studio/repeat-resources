1
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:10,650
Hi, John! are you riding in a car?

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,760
Hi, Faith! Yes, my friend is taking me to the airport.

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,450
Turn left at the intersection, then go straight.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,020
So, John, what's our lesson for today?

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,500
Well, I think we should discuss cars.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,350
Really? How so?

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,510
A car is a vehicle for getting people or goods across an area.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,750
We can think of a sentence as a vehicle for getting information across to other people.

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,610
I see.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,880
And we might use sentences for special purposes

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,930
- just as we might use a kind of car for a special purpose.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,030
Can you think of an example?

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,070
The imperative sentence.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,000
The imperative sentence generally consists of a predicate.

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,010
The subject is left out.

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,570
You recently heard an example of an imperative sentence:

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,410
Turn left at the intersection then go straight.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,510
You might compare imperative sentences to race cars.

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,090
Race cars are designed for getting from one point to another point as fast as possible

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,010
Race car makers take out many elements to get the lowest possible weight.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,940
For example, race cars do not have sound systems or seats for passengers.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,100
In the same way, imperative statements are designed for getting meaning across as fast as possible.

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,820
Speakers take out important sentence elements to express information as quickly as possible

24
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,760
And that's Everyday Grammar TV

25
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:55,350
