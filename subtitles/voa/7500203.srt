00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,189
This is a chip.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,860
Delicious.

4
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:16,475
But why would someone have a chip on their shoulder.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,713
Dan, do you have any idea why Craig is mad at me

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,873
He's just got a chip on his shoulder.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,832
It still bothers him that you got that promotion instead of him.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,052
That was months ago.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,330
He needs to get over it.

10
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:37,534
I agree.

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,720
If someone has a chip on their shoulder,

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,056
they feel angry about a past situation.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,990
They hold onto the belief that they were treated unfairly.

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,183
This makes them generally unpleasant to be around.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,790
And that's English in a Minute!
