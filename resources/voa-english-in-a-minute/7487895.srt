Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,700
Gold is a valuable material.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,450
We can dig gold out of mountains and get rich!

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,466
So, is that what gold digger means?

5
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:18,690
Bob seems really upset these days

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,841
That's understandable.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,630
He lost a lot of money in the stock market.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,119
How did that happen?

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,446
Bob needed a lot of money fast,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,650
or his wife said

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,530
she was going to leave him.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,610
Wow!

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,040
She sounds like a real gold digger.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,950
In the mid 1800s,

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,770
lots of people went to the American West

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,140
to dig for newly found gold.

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,570
They were called gold diggers.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,200
But these days, a gold digger is

19
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:57,630
a person who chooses their relationships based on money,  not love
