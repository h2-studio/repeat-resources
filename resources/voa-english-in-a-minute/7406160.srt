Welcome to English in a Minute!

00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:12,216
In baseball, a pinch hitter replaces a batter in the line up.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,260
Are Anna and Dan starting a baseball team?

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,931
Dan.

5
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:19,920
Did you notice something different?

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,240
You're wearing a new shirt.

7
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:22,742
No. Dan.

8
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:24,240
I'm not talking about me.

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,250
I'm talking about our show.

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,120
What's different?

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,010
Caty is pinch hitting for Ashley as host!

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,590
But I am wearing a new shirt.

13
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:40,320
A pinch hitter replaces another player at bat

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,860
during a critical point in a baseball game.

15
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:48,412
But it also means to substitute for someone,

16
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,270
especially in an emergency.

17
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:58,086
You can pinch hit for someone in your personal life or at work.
