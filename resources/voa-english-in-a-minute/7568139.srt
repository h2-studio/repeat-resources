00:00:04,226 --> 00:00:05,850
Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,550
Gulf is played on a course.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,410
If you're good at golf,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,530
a par is what you should expect to score.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,250
But what does par for the course mean?

6
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:21,180
It's 3:02. Where is everybody?

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,540
Dan, relax, people are going to come.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,650
I specifically said on the invitation 3 o'clock.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,390
So rude.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,220
it's not rude, Dan.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,750
It's par for the course for people to come a little later to a party.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,180
It's not par for the course for me.

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,840
Par for the course means what is normal or expected in any sort of situation.

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,942
It is normal to come to a party a little late.

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,310
With as many parties as you have, Dan,

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,630
you should know that.
