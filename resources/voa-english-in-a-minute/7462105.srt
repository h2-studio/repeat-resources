00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,850
Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,590
Bones are strong.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,540
They make up our skeleton.

4
00:00:10,073 --> 00:00:14,633
But what could it mean to have a bone to pick with someone?

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,940
Dan, are you ready to read scripts?

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:18,780
Maybe.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,490
Dan, umm, are you upset about something?

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,750
Actually, yes!

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,400
I have a bone to pick with you.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,380
What did i do now?

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,660
Well, your new script is about a co-worker who is always late and grumpy.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,070
It's about me, isn't it?

13
00:00:35,089 --> 00:00:37,230
No. No. No,

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,650
you are never late!

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,360
When you have a bone to pick with someone,

16
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:48,563
you have an issue with them that bothers you.

17
00:00:49,206 --> 00:00:53,256
If you have a bone to pick with a co-worker or friend,

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,420
it is best to talk about it sooner rather than later.
