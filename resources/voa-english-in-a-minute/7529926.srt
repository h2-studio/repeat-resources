00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,940
Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:08,713
To rush means to move quickly.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,630
and tread is another way of saying "walk."

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,330
So, is the phrase, fools rush in where angels fear to tread,

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,609
advice for a foot race?

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,760
Something big is happening outside!

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,390
There are tons of police,(a) fire engine and a crowd of people.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,500
Come on, let's go!

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,548
No way.

10
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:33,810
Remember: fools rush in where angels fear to tread.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,900
Forget pools and angels, Dan. Let's go!

12
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:38,880
I'll just wait here!

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,170
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,080
means that it is foolish to act in a situation full of unknowns.

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,620
We often just shorten it to fools rush in.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,510
This is good advice.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,750
It is wise to wait sometimes, Anna.
