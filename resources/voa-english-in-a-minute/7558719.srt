00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,880
Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,700
If you crack something, you break it.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,810
But what does someone mean if they tell you to get cracking?

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,500
Dan, can you help me with my proposal?

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,270
You mean the one that's due tonight?

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,740
Let me see what you've got.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,070
Well, I don't have much...

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,620
or, um, anything.

9
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:27,120
Are you serious?

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,940
You only have five hours!

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,700
Well then, we'd better get cracking!

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,020
We?

13
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:41,543
Get cracking is a way of telling someone to do something right away.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,190
You can also say it about yourself,

15
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,240
,as in,

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,910
"I should get cracking on my homework."

17
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:52,403
People sometimes drop the full "ing" sound

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,420
and just say, get crackin'.

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,910
and that's English in a Minute!
