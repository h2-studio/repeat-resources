00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,850
Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,270
Z is the last letter of the alphabet.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,560
So, what does it mean to catch some z's?

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,210
Let's find out.

5
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:18,540
What time did you go to bed last night?

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,680
Too late!

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,800
I practice my accordion all night.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,612
Well, we have a lot of work to do today.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,890
Just let me catch some z's at my desk.

10
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:30,314
That's not a good idea.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,520
You're right!

12
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:34,830
I'll go into the recording studio.

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,320
It's quieter there.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,180
To catch some z's means to sleep.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,090
Some people snore when they sleep.

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,836
so this term comes from the buzzing sound of snoring.

17
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:55,434
comics and even emojis use z's to represent sleep.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,050
and that's English in a Minute!
