Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,670
A plug provides electricity.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,330
So, what happens when you pull the plug?

4
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:16,219
My first annual pickleball celebration party

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,150
is way over budget.

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,450
Well, Dan, maybe you don't need, uh, a 10-piece jazz band?

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,110
And the snake handler alone costs a thousand dollars.

8
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:29,910
But I love snakes.

9
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:33,260
Maybe I just pull the plug on this whole thing.

10
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:39,876
You just need to pull the plug on the $500 chocolate fountain?!

11
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:48,713
Pulling the plug just means to put an end to a plan or activity.

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,980
If I were Dan, I'd pull the plug on the snake handler,

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,660
not the chocolate fountain!

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,480
And that's English in a Minute!
