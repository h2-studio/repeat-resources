Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,226 --> 00:00:12,916
Long ago, England controlled an area around Dublin, Ireland, known as the Pale.

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,120
But what to think beyond the pale means as an idiom?

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,070
This is weird.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,010
I left my sandwich in the break room,

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,180
and now it's gone.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,170
I think I saw Bob eating it.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,190
Bob?!

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,240
He's done bad things before, but stealing my sandwich?

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,400
That is beyond the pale.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,210
I agree.

12
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:38,100
Especially a tuna sandwich.

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,030
Wait.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,120
How did you know it was tuna, Dan?!

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,770
When someone's behavior is beyond the pale,

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,710
they have gone past what is acceptable.

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,130
It can even be offensive or immoral.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,600
I think stealing and lying are beyond the pale, Dan.
