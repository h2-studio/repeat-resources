00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,030
Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,697 --> 00:00:08,040
This is the bottom

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,670
and this is the top.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,530
But what does it mean to be over the top?

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,700
Dan, one of Caty's pens is missing!

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,290
She probably lost it.

7
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:21,413
Besides it's just a pen.

8
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:22,260
No, no, no.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,790
It's her favorite pen.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,340
First, we interviewed witnesses.

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,010
And then, we dust for fingerprints!

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,830
Don't you think that's a bit over the top?

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,820
Dan, this is the case we've been waiting for!

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,620
We?

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,000
Over the top is used to describe something that's too extreme

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,790
or requires too much effort for a situation

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,840
Some decorations or clothes are over the top

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,390
So is collecting fingerprints to find a pen that I borrowed!
