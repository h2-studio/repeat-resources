00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,850
Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,980
These are dice.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,420
But what do you think the adjective dicey means?

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,560
Let's listen.

5
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:18,097
So, Anna, is your tree-cutting party still on this weekend?

6
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:19,380
Yes!

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,890
Although the weather could be dicey

8
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:26,813
lightning, thunder, maybe a tornado.

9
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:31,366
Well, cutting down a tree in a storm sounds very dicey

10
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:33,240
and dumb.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,330
Nah, it'll be fine.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,860
What could go wrong?

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,900
There is no way to predict how dice are going to roll.

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,720
So, dicey describes something that is unpredictable or risky.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
You can use dicey when talking about lots of things

16
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:57,077
the weather, a physical activity, or even a business decision.
