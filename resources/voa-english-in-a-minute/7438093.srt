00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,540
Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,470
A hatchet is a small axe.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,650
Why would you want to bury one?

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,490
Dan, you really shouldn't have said that to Denise.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,660
She started it.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,630
She stole my secret muffin recipe!

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,220
She wouldn't do that, Dan.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,790
She knows how important your muffin recipe is to you.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,870
Then why do her muffins taste exactly like mine, Anna?

10
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:35,333
Dan, look, you need to talk to her and bury the hatchet.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,020
To bury the hatchet means to make peace.

12
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:46,215
We often use this expression when there are two opposing people or groups

13
00:00:46,662 --> 00:00:49,596
that settle their disagreement about something.

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,900
Unfortunately, it can be hard to bury the hatchet

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,690
when it involves Dan's muffins.
