Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,540
A lane is a narrow road or path.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,620
But what and where is memory lane?

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,630
And how do people get there?

5
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:18,578
Hey, Anna. How was lunch with your old friend?

6
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:19,740
Awesome.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,040
We took a long trip down memory lane.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,900
We even talked about our old elementary school teacher, Mr. Burpee.

9
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:29,700
Mr. Burpee?

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,110
Really?

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,610
Hey, Dan. The Burpees were a very powerful family in our town.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,800
We don't make fun of the Burpees.

13
00:00:39,796 --> 00:00:46,666
A trip down memory lane happens when you spend time thinking about or talking about the past.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,760
We mostly use this when remembering good memories

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,850
and not the less pleasant times from our past.

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,640
and that's English in a Minute!
