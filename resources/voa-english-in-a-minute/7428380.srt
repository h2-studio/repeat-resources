00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,810
Welcome to English in a Minute!

2
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:09,930
Everyone loves a good party!

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,167
But maybe not all parties.

4
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:16,005
Let's go to a pity party.

5
00:00:16,956 --> 00:00:19,216
You would not believe my morning.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,720
First, I was late to the gym.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,520
You belong to a gym?

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,693
Wow, you are so lucky!

9
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:28,120
And then I forgot my coffee.

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,250
I'll buy your coffee.

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,266
And then...

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,886
Dan! Let's take a walk.

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,580
Walking will bring you out of this pity party that you're in.

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,970
A pity party is when a person feels sorry for themselves.

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,560
That's the pity part.

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,532
Maybe, they feel unlucky or that they have been treated unfairly.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,690
And then they talk about it a lot.

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,670
That's the party part.

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,040
Except it's not a party.

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,600
It's a downer.
