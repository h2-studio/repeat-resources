00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,702
Welcome to English in a minute

2
00:00:06,242 --> 00:00:10,020
a third degree burn requires medical attention

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,763
but is this what Ana and Dan are talking about when they say the third degree.

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,216
Hey, I'm headed to the lunch meeting

5
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:19,160
you want to walk with me

6
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:25,518
No thanks. I 'm busy doing other things far away with other people.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,060
What are you doing?

8
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:28,626
Where are you going?

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,850
Who are you meeting?

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,400
Dan, stop with the third degree!

11
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:38,008
If you don't want so many questions, I need answers.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,075
A third degree is a long and intense period of questioning

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,000
We usually call it the third degree.

14
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:52,300
It is what police officers do to get information

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,830
or even a confession from a suspect

16
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,271
and that's English in a minute.
