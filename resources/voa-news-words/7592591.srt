Researchers studying four kinds of great apes

have learned of a surprising similarity between the animals and humans.

TEASE

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,020
Researchers found that the great apes tease in the same way children do

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,430
showing playful behaviors with surprises.
