Hi, John.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,020
Hi, Faith!

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,530
Let's continue our lesson on grammar and cars.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,020
A quick reminder for our viewers:

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,750
Just as there are different kinds of cars,

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,660
there are also different kinds of sentences.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,150
Let's turn our attention to a kind of sentence you are likely to hear or use when driving:

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,532
exclamatory sentences.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,310
Grammar books describe exclamatory sentences in two ways:

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,420
in terms of emotion and in terms of word order.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,230
The first way we describe exclamatory sentences

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,060
is in terms of emotion.

13
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:50,381
When we are driving, that emotion is often - but not always - negative.

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,370
I can't believe he cut me off!

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,360
The second kind of exclamatory sentence involves a change of word order.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,440
We often use "what" or "how" in these kinds of statements.

17
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,500
We also often leave out the verb.

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,120
For example, imagine you are stuck in heavy traffic.

19
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,250
A person speeds up and cuts in front of you.

20
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,030
You might say in a negative tone:

21
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,470
"What a piece of work!"

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,080
or something like this:

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,436
"what the --- !"

24
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,520
This kind of exclamatory sentence is not polite,

25
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,770
and we do not suggest using it.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,120
But you might hear it or something like it in a film or in real life.

27
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,640
And That's Everyday Grammar TV.
