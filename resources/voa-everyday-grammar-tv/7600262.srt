Hi, John!

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,420
Let's continue our lesson on price discussions.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,440
Absolutely - it's such a fun and useful topic.

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,810
Here is a quick reminder.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,110
In the previous lesson, we explored this question:

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,450
How much does this cost?

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,470
We compared "how much" to the star far of a movie.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,950
"How much" often appears in questions about prices

9
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:36,270
just like the main star appears in most scenes in a movie.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,850
We mentioned that other words in our example question are sometimes left out.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,040
We compared these words to supporting actors or background actors

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,070
How much does this cost?

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,650
For example, we sometimes leave out the verb "cost."

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,790
And in some cases, we leave out the helping verb "do."

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,910
Instead, we use the verb "be."

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,190
I like to compare "be" to a kind of stunt double for "do."

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,260
For example, instead of asking "how much does this cost?,"

18
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:16,632
A person might ask "how much is this?"

19
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:18,093
or

20
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:19,711
"how much is it?."

21
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:24,893
Please note these three questions have almost the same meaning:

22
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,630
How much does this cost?

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,400
How much is this?

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,140
How much is it?

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,600
Let's end with a quiz.

26
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,570
Imagine you see an object for sale.

27
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,200
What are two ways to ask about the price?

28
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:43,320
Here are two possible answers"

29
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,590
How much does this cost?

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,440
How much is this?

31
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,530
And that's Everyday Grammar TV.
