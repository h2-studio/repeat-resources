Hi, Dr. Jill!

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,740
What's on your mind today?

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,260
I recently went to a farmer's market.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,470
I heard so many people discussing prices.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,953
It's an important subject to explore.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,050
You know, Dr. Jill, I love comparisons.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,570
They really help make learning more enjoyable.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,076
When I teach about price discussions,

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,940
I like to make a comparison to a movie.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,110
Let's call our movie "Price Questions."

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,320
The star of our film is "how much."

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,950
"How much" often appears in questions about prices

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,390
just like a main actor appears in many of the scenes in a movie.

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,780
If we continue the comparison,

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,970
we could say that the verb "cost" is the most important supporting actor.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,520
But sometimes it is left out

17
00:00:57,226 --> 00:01:02,140
just like how a supporting actor might appear in fewer scenes in a film.

18
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,300
Finally, we have a few background actors.

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,460
You might not notice them as much.

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,860
These are words such as "do," "be," "that," "it," or "this."

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,500
Let's take an example.

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,300
How much does this cost?

23
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,430
The general order of appearance is this:

24
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,250
How much + helping verb + subject + main verb (cost)

25
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,800
There is much more to say about price discussions.

26
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,340
But we will have to cover those issues in a future lesson.

27
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:47,003
And that's Everyday Grammar TV.
