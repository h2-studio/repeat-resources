Hello! I'm John Russell.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,910
Let's continue our exploration of common words,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,130
phrases and questions in American English.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,750
In recent lessons, we talked about how to ask for directions.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,010
But what do you say when someone asks you for directions?

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,020
Two words are especially important for giving directions:

7
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:27,240
left and right.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,350
Today we will focus on the word "left."

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,750
We can start by breaking the word into its individual sounds.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,550
We have one vowel sound and a few consonant sounds.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's start with the last sound first.

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,690
Watch my mouth carefully and repeat after me:

13
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:53,255
/t/

14
00:00:54,113 --> 00:00:57,833
Now let's do the last two consonant sound slowly.

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,510
Pay careful attention to my lips.

16
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:06,359
/ft/

17
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,330
The vowel sound comes next.

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,672
Once again, pay careful attention to my mouth.

19
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:14,310
Repeat after me:

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,530
/e/

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,380
/eft/

22
00:01:21,476 --> 00:01:22,163
/eft/

23
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:25,706
We are almost done with the word.

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,230
We have one final consonant sound

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,540
the tricky "l" sound.

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,560
Watch closely, listen, and repeat after me.

27
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:36,540
/l/

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,180
/l/

29
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,940
/left/

30
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,520
/left/

31
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,078
That's all for today!

32
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:48,360
Keep up the good work!

33
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:56,060
